These are OCaml bindings to the library TA-Lib at `https://ta-lib.org/`.  Of course, you will need to install TA-Lib to use these bindings.  The raw bindings are exposed in `Tacaml.Raw`, with all arguments to the functions exposed.  There are nicer wrappers available in `Tacaml.F` that I find easier to use.  This library does not use the TA-Lib abstraction layer and at the moment I haven't created bindings to any of the lookback function.
